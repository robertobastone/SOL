# SOL
SOng Lyrics (SOL) is a little script that retrieves the first <i>n</i> verses of a given song (whose title is hardcoded). This value is determined accordingly to the length of the verses, i.e. the total number of the characters in these <i>n</i> verses cannot be greater than a value (hardcoded as well). The lyrics are retrieved via the service provided by
